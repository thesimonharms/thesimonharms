# Hi there! 👋 I'm Simon Harms

I'm a student, self-hosting enthusiast, and programmer with a deep love for *nix, low-level systems, and clean code. I’m currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis while building fun and meaningful tools from the terminal up.

### 🔧 Projects I'm Working On
- **`lmsg`** — A decentralized CLI messaging system inspired by answering machines, `mail` and IRC, written in Rust.
- **Emacs Customization** — Crafting a snappy, minimalist Emacs setup with `hydra`, `org-mode`, and no evil-mode.

### 💻 Tech I Enjoy
`Rust` • `C#` • `Python` • `Haskell` • `C++` • `Emacs` • `Unix` • `Git` • `Docker`

### 🌱 Learning Goals
I'm diving deeper into:
- Systems programming (Rust, OS concepts)
- Functional programming
- AI & machine learning
- Network infrastructure
- Databases

### 🤝 Let’s Connect
If you're into open-source, lightweight tools, or just love talking about Emacs and Linux, feel free to connect or explore my projects!
